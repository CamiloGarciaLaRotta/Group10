\section{Description}
\subsection{Detailed Domain Model}
The Detail Design Diagram consists of the following entities: ApplicationManager, ProfileManager,
CourseManager, Application, Profile, Course, Job, Instructor, Admin, Student, Laboratory, and
Tutorial. It consists of a Controller, called Controller, a Boundary, called View, and a
Persistence, called Persistence XStream. The Controller uses the entities ApplicationManager,
ProfileManager, and CourseManager to save, edit, and modify data within the model, which are then
saved within a persistence layer. The functionalities of the three "Manager" classes are listed
below.
\begin{itemize}
	\item ApplicationManager is in charge of Application, the job application created and submitted
		by the student for a job. It is associated with Application, Job, and ProfileManager.
	\item ProfileManager creates Admin, Instructor, and Student entities, all of which inherit from
		the Profile class.
	\item CourseManager creates Course entities.
\end{itemize}
In total there will be three controller classes in the Controller Packages with an additional class
for input exceptions or input validation. The three controller classes will each use at least one of
the manager classes.
\section{Rationale}
\subsection{Detailed Domain Model}
The three Manager classes were needed in order to give functionality to the user to create the
entities associated with the manager classes, except for ApplicationManager creating a
ProfileManager. The reason ApplicationManager is associated to ProfileManager is because otherwise
the only way for ApplicationManager to have access to Student is by a direct association to it; this
would cause a redundancy as now two manager classes are able to create Student entities, which is
something we want to avoid. Having a separate controller for each manager class allows one to modify
the functionality of one controller class with its respective manager class without it having to
affect the other controller classes.
