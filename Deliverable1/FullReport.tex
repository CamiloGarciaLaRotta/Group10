\chapter{TAMAS Domain Model}
The following UMPLE code was written for the generation of the TAMAS domain model:

The corresponding class diagram generated by UMPLE may be found below:\\\\

\chapter{Use Cases}
After designing an original use case diagram consisting of all actors and use cases, it was decided
that the diagram was too crowded and thus hard to read. Therefore, three separate use case diagrams
were created in order to alleviate eye strain and clarify the actions.
\section{Use Case Diagrams}
\subsection{Administrator Use Case Diagram}

%\end{tabular}
\chapter{Sequence Diagrams}
The following sequence diagrams were designed to display the sequence of actions that will occur in
the use of the applications. One sequence diagram was designed per actor, and another was designed
to demonstrate the authentication process. It is important to note that before authentication, the
user has no identity, and is thus neither a student, an instructor, or an administrator, but just a
default Profile.

\chapter{Statechart for Job Class}
The following statechart was conceived to emphasize the roles and navigations of different states of
the applications.
\includegraphics{model/Diagrams/StateDiagram/StateChartDiagram.pdf}

\chapter{Work Plan for Remaining Iterations}
%\includegraphics{workplan}
Remaining iterations of the requirements should only modify the nonfunctional
requirements. All functional requirements should have been accounted for. Modifications to
the nonfunctional requirements should not require any changes to the software architecture
after it has been designed.
The use cases and actors change due to the addition of new features; new use cases can
be generated. The current functionality has been modeled in our use cases.
The Domain model is planned to change. We have a profile manager which will
authenticate username and passwords; however, the architecture which has yet to be designed
may require changes to the domain model in the future.
There are currently no plans to change the state chart for the job class.
The sequence diagrams currently account for how the different actors interact with
other actors and objects. The architectural details of the software should not change this.
In the next week, we plan to develop the software architecture and details of the class
diagrams which will allow us to move on to the development of source code.
In the following week, we will create more detailed sequence diagrams going into the
details of the implementations on individual platforms. We will then develop prototype source
code for the \textit{Publish Job Posting} and \textit{Apply for Job} use cases for the desktop and mobile
applications respectively.
