\chapter{TAMAS Domain Model}
The following UMPLE code was written for the generation of the TAMAS domain model:
%\begin{figure}
\lstinputlisting[language=Java,frame=single]{model/TAMAS.ump}
%\end{figure}
%\\
The corresponding class diagram generated by UMPLE may be found below:\\\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{model/Diagrams/classdiagram}

\chapter{Use Cases}
After designing an original use case diagram consisting of all actors and use cases, it was decided
that the diagram was too crowded and thus hard to read. Therefore, three separate use case diagrams
were created in order to alleviate eye strain and clarify the actions. The UML code that was used to
generate the use case diagrams may be found in \hyperref[appA]{Appendix A}.
\section{Use Case Diagrams}
\subsection{Administrator Use Case Diagram}
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{model/Diagrams/UC/adminUC}
\\
Firstly, the \textbf{Administrators} must be able to access the \textit{user sign in form}. This is
extended as \textit{Sign in as Admin} in the use case diagram which is handled by the
\textbf{Security Authentication} actor. The \textbf{administrators} may then \textit{Upload Student
Enrollment Data} and \textit{Upload List of Courses} which contains the information needed to
generate the intitial schedules and budgets needed. \textit{Generate Initial Allocation} includes
\textit{Assess Application List} which takes into account the fact that initial allocation will need
to be assessed by the department. \textit{Calculate Default TA and Grader Hours} include
\textit{Assess Student Enrollment Data} and \textit{Assess Courses Information} which are necessary
to calculate the TA and Grader work hours.
\subsection{Instructor Use Case Diagram}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{model/Diagrams/UC/instructorUC}
\\
\textbf{Instructors} must be able to access \textit{user sign in} as instructors. \textit{User sign in}
therefore extends \textit{sign in as instructor} which is handled by \textbf{Security
Authentication}. \textbf{Instructors} may then access the \textit{Publish Job Posting} form. After
the job has been published and \textbf{students} have applied, \textbf{instructors} may modify the
first allocation under the \textit{modify initial allocation} use case as needed. After the
semester, the \textbf{instructor} has the ability to access the \textit{Evaluate TA or Grader} form
to provide feedback on the performance of hired \textbf{students}.
\subsection{Student Use Case Diagram}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{model/Diagrams/UC/studentUC}
\\
\textbf{Students} must be able to access the \textit{user sign in} form as students.
\textbf{Security Authentication} authorizes the \textbf{student} to \textit{sign in as student}.
From there, the \textbf{student} may use the \textit{Apply to Job Posting} forms to apply to
available positions. This includes the use of forms to \textit{Submit Past TA or Grader Experience}
and \textit{Submit Personal Details}. Finally, if job offers are sent to a \textbf{student}, he or
she may access an \textit{Accept or Reject Job Offer} form.
\chapter{Sequence Diagrams}
The following sequence diagrams were designed to display the sequence of actions that will occur in
the use of the applications. One sequence diagram was designed per actor, and another was designed
to demonstrate the authentication process. It is important to note that before authentication, the
user has no identity, and is thus neither a student, an instructor, or an administrator, but just a
default Profile.

\section{Administrator Sequence}

\section{Instructor Sequence}
\includegraphics[scale=0.9]{model/Diagrams/Sequence/SeqInstructor}
\section{Student Sequence}
\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{model/Diagrams/Sequence/SeqStudent}
\section{Authentication Sequence}
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{model/Diagrams/Sequence/SeqAuthentication}

\chapter{Statechart for Job Class}
The following statechart was conceived to emphasize the roles and navigations of different states of
the applications. The UML code used to generate the statechart diagram may be seen in
\hyperref[appB]{Appendix B}.\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.9]{model/Diagrams/StateDiagram/StateChartDiagram.pdf}

\chapter{Work Plan for Remaining Iterations}
%\includegraphics{workplan}
Remaining iterations of the requirements should only modify the nonfunctional
requirements. All functional requirements should have been accounted for. Modifications to
the nonfunctional requirements should not require any changes to the software architecture
after it has been designed.
The use cases and actors change due to the addition of new features; new use cases can
be generated. The current functionality has been modeled in our use cases.
The Domain model is planned to change. We have a profile manager which will
authenticate username and passwords; however, the architecture which has yet to be designed
may require changes to the domain model in the future.
There are currently no plans to change the state chart for the job class.
The sequence diagrams currently account for how the different actors interact with
other actors and objects. The architectural details of the software should not change this.
In the next week, we plan to develop the software architecture and details of the class
diagrams which will allow us to move on to the development of source code.
In the following week, we will create more detailed sequence diagrams going into the
details of the implementations on individual platforms. We will then develop prototype source
code for the \textit{Publish Job Posting} and \textit{Apply for Job} use cases for the desktop and mobile
applications respectively.
