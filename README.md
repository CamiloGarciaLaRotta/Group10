[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ECSE321-Winter2017-McGill/Group10.svg?token=RjSJXSnzv8LjryFGTxf4&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ECSE321-Winter2017-McGill/Group10)

### Structure
Each deliverable is self contained in its repository, the latest backlog is kept apart.  
A brief description of each delivery follows.

*  __Deliverable #1__ 
    * Requirement Document with Functional and non-functional system requirements
    * Use cases addressing each functional requirement
    * Domain model of the prototype architecture
    * Statechart for class “Job”
    * Requirements-level sequence diagram covering the main scenario of the entire TA management process for all stakeholders
    * Work plan for remaining iterations

*  __Deliverable #2__
	* Architecture with Desription, Rationale, Block Diagram(s)
	* Detailed Design with Description, Rationale, Class Diagram(s)
	* "Publish Job Posting" use case for Desktop + Implementation-level sequence diagram
	* "Publish Job Posting" use case for Web + Implementation-level sequence diagram
	* "Apply for Job" use case for Desktop + Implementation-level sequence diagram
	* "Apply for Job" use case for Mobile + Implementation-level sequence diagram
	* Demonstration of individual and teamwork
	* GitHub usage and Work plan for completed and remaining iterations
	
*  __Deliverable #3__
	* Unit Test Plan:
		Checklist with classes that need to be tested and which classes do not need to be tested
	* Integration Strategy:
		Plan and order in which classes and subsystems that will be tested
	* System Test Plan:
		How whole system will be tested
	* Updated Work Plan:
		Updated work and remaining work for remaining iterations of implementation
		
*  __Deliverable #4__
	* Release Pipeline Plan: Integration, Build, and Deploment plans must be documented
		Describe how code is changed, compiled, tested, packaged, and released
		Describe tools used to support each phase
	* Updated Work Plan: Define the completed and remaining iterations of implementation until the final deliverable
		Each completed iteration, indicate which requirements are addressed, report the effort needed to complete
		the iteration, estimate effort needed to complete iteration, and date for completion.
*  __Deliverable #5__
	* Presentation
		Grading:
		Effectiveness of presentation (Communication and organization)
		Content of presentation
		Quality of slides
		Live Demo
*  __Deliverable #6__
	* Final report: Includes comments on Correctness of the implementation of the main features, Usability of application,
	Testing of the applications, Release pipeline
	* Submit Final Software
