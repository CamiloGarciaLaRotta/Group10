\subsection{Key Decisions}

%\textbf{ADD HERE ALL THE DECISIONS YALL TOOK}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Requirement Document}
    \item \textbf{Use Cases}
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item Included four actors in the diagram, three of which are users and one of which is a service. The three users are: Student, Instructor and Department (has administrator privileges). The service is a Security Authentication.
    	\item Each user in the diagram acts upon multiple use cases respective to their functionalities mentioned in the Requirements and Specifications documents. Each use case describes functionality that its respective actor has.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Class Diagram}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Trying to mimic the architecture of the event registration app, an early choice was to have a JobManager oversee the job transactions between Instructors and Students
        \item Each user, whether it has administrator, instructor or student access rights, is obliged to have profile instance to facilitate identity access management
		\item Later, it was also decided to have a ProfileManager to handle the actors' profiles and
			their authentication.
        \item To enable an administrator to recreate actions available to instructors or student, we give the class administrator the power to create instances of the aforementioned users
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sequence Diagram}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item For convenience and concision, it was decided to design sequence diagrams for each
				main user action.
			\item The sequence diagrams may contain actions from multiple user classes to emphasize
				the sequence. For example, in the Instructor sequence diagram, the action of an
				administrator verifying Instructor modifications to the TA/Grader hours is seen.
			\item The current sequence diagrams include Student actions, Instructor actions,
				Administrator actions, and the authentication process.
		\end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{State Chart}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The state chart tracks the possible states of the job posting between being created and the position being filled.
            \item The chart also indicates the triggers required to transition between job posting states.

        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Work Plan}

In the following week, we will create more detailed sequence diagrams going into the details of the implementations on individual platforms. We will then develop prototype source code for the Publish Job Posting and Apply for Job use cases for the desktop and mobile applications respectively.

\subsection{Main Tasks}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Harley Wiltzer
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Aided in the design of the revamped domain model
		\item Designed and developed desktop application
		\item Aided in the design of the mobile application
		\item Created the Sequence diagram for the Desktop - Apply to Job Use Case
		\item Helped create the Sequence Diagram for the Desktop - Publish Job Posting Use Case
		\item Compiled the final report
	\end{itemize}
    \item Camilo Garcia La Rotta
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Designed and documented Sequence Diagrams for the Web and Desktop implementation of "Publish Job Posting"
        \item Derived the PHP code implementation of "Publish Job Posting" and "Apply to Job Posting" based on the aforementioned design-level Class Diagram
    \end{itemize}

		\begin{itemize}
			\item Co-designed preliminary Architecture Block Diagram
            \item Helped with design of Detailed Design Diagram

    	\item Wrote draft for Architecture's Description and Rationale
    	\item Co-designed Detailed Design Class Diagram

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Key Decisions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Use Cases}
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item In order to correctly implement the Entity-Control-Boundary pattern and symbolism in the Use Cases, the naming of the cases from the first deliverable were reviewed and adjusted. Moreover, the relationships between each action was refined so as to reflect the following rules:
    	\begin{itemize}
    	    \item Actor only interacts with $<<$Boundary$>>$
    	    \item $<<$Entity$>>$ only interacts with $<<$Control$>>$
    	    \item $<<$Control$>>$ manages the interaction flow between $<<$Boundary$>>$ and $<<$Entity$>>$
    	\end{itemize}
    	\item The overall structure of the Use Case for deliverable \#2 focused solely on the Profile subclasses Admin and Instructor. To highlight this structure the Use Cases made a deliberate use of Generalization.
        \item The "Publish Job Posting" Sequence diagram had to be clear about the alternative actions based on the approval or disapproval of the Posting instance. As such, an ALT pane was implemented only for the Web Use Case, which didn't necessarily imply the posting would be automatically approved. As opposed to the Desktop application, only used by Admin which ensures the posting is automatically approved at the moment of submitting a publish form.
		\item It was decided that the Desktop app can handle the creation of all major entities.
			Starting with no data, the Desktop app has the power to create all necessary actors for
			all features of the program to be possible.
		\item For the purpose of Deliverable 2, the mobile app does not have the ability to create
			student profiles. Students register for jobs by specifying their username, as
			authentication has not been implemented yet.
		\item Since the mobile app does not support the creation of Students or Jobs, it was decided
			that it should programmatically create Students and Jobs if no current persistence XML
			file is found. This was decided solely for the convenience of the graders of this
			deliverable. If this is not desired, the grader may input his/her own XML to the
			appropriate directory.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Domain Model}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item ProfileManager, CourseManager, and ApplicationManager were added to the domain model
			to assist in the creation and persistence of Profiles, Courses, Jobs, and Applications.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
