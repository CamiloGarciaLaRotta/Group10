\section{Description}
	In this section we will present an extensive suite of test cases aimed to cover in the most
	efficient manner possible the Fantasy Basketball system we are to deliver. Following the
	paradigm of Test-Driven Development, we shall also implement the unit test cases. This will help
	keep the development of the system on track with the requirements imposed to the team. 
	
\section{Test Cases}
    All the classes to test will have the following pattern:\\
    
    \textbf{CLASS TO TEST/NOT TO TEST}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Reason to test/not to test
        \item attributes and related tests
    \end{itemize}
    
    \subsection{Classes To Test}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Course}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Reason to test:} This class is intrinsic to the job posting and application transaction. Its attributes TA/Grader time budget define how many students can apply to the position. Less relative to the application, but still needed for the correct behaviour of the process is the fact that the student must have experience in the given course in order to apply for a position as TA/Grader for it.
            \item \textbf{Test Cases:} 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{className}: test for null, empty, only numerical and only spaces inputs.
                \item \textbf{CDN}: test for non-unique, null, empty, not alphabetic and only spaces inputs.
                \item \textbf{className}: test for null, empty, not numerical and only spaces inputs.
                \item \textbf{graderTimeBudget/taTimeBudget}: test for null, empty, not numerical and negative inputs.
                \item \textbf{Jobs}: test for retrieval of job list
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Job}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Reason to test:} This class is intrinsic to the job posting and application transaction. It encapsulates half of the persistence aspect of the app which is to publish and view job postings.
            \item \textbf{Test Cases:} 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{CDN}: test for non-existent, null, empty, only numerical and only spaces inputs.
                \item \textbf{requirements}: test for null, empty, empty and only spaces inputs.
                \item \textbf{position}: test for null inputs.
                \item \textbf{salary}: test for null, empty, not numerical and negative inputs.
                \item \textbf{day}: test for null, empty and weekend inputs.
               \item \textbf{startTime/endTime}: test for null, empty and outside of working hours inputs.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Tutorial}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Reason to test:} This class is intrinsic to the job posting and application transaction. Job postings are for either TA/Grader. In the first case, the availabilities of the TA must be compatible with those of the tutorial.
            \item \textbf{Test Cases:} 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item test the same attributes as Course to ensure inheritance was correctly implemented by the UML
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Laboratory}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Reason to test:} This class is intrinsic to the job posting and application transaction. Job postings are for either TA/Grader. In the first case, the availabilities of the TA must be compatible with those of the laboratory.
            \item \textbf{Test Cases:} 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item test the same attributes as Course to ensure inheritance was correctly implemented by the UML
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Profile}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Reason to test:} This class is intrinsic to the job posting and application transaction. The system requires profile identifiers to discern which methods and attributes each instance has access to.
            \item \textbf{Test Cases:} 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{id}:test for non-unique, null, empty, not alphabetic and only spaces inputs.
                \item \textbf{username}: test for non-unique, null, empty, not alphanumeric and only spaces inputs.
                \item \textbf{password}: test for invalid difficulty, null and empty inputs.
                \item \textbf{firstName/lastName}: test for null, empty, not alphabetical and only spaces inputs.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize} 
        
        \item \textbf{Student}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Reason to test:} This class is intrinsic to the job posting and application transaction. The student is the only instance of profile allowed to apply to a job posting.
            \item \textbf{Test Cases:} 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item test the same attributes as Profile to ensure inheritance was correctly implemented by the UML
                \item \textbf{experience}: test for null, empty and only spaces inputs.
                \item \textbf{degree}: test for null inputs.
                \item \textbf{Jobs}: test for retrieval of job list
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Instructor}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Reason to test:} This class is intrinsic to the job posting and application transaction. The instructor is the only instance of profile allowed to post jobs.
            \item \textbf{Test Cases:} 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item test the same attributes as Profile to ensure inheritance was correctly implemented by the UML
                \item \textbf{experience}: test for null, empty and only spaces inputs.
                \item \textbf{degree}: test for null inputs.
                \item \textbf{Jobs}: test for retrieval and modification of job list
                \item \textbf{Application}: test for retrieval of application list
                \item \textbf{course}: test for retrieval of course list
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        
        	\item \textbf{Application}
        	\begin{itemize}
        		\item \textbf{Reason to test:} This class is necessary for the Student to apply for a job. Each application is associated to a student and a job posting; hence one needs to test for different Student attributes for different Jobs.
        		\item \textbf{Test Cases:} 
        		\begin{itemize}
        			\item \textbf{Test Apply for a Job:} test for error if hours are not compatible, test for error if job is null, and test for error if student is null.
        		\end{itemize}
        		
        	\end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        
        \begin{itemize}
        	\item \textbf{Admin}
        	\begin{itemize}
        		\item \textbf{Reason to test:} This class is intrinsic to the creation of a course, the creation of a Student and Instructor, and application transaction. Its attributes inherit from profile. They define information about the person that is registering an admin profile; hence it is needed to test for different attribute inputs and for successful creation of classes.
        		\item \textbf{Test Cases:} 
        		\begin{itemize}
        			\item test the same attributes as Profile to ensure inheritance was correctly implemented by the UML
        			\item \textbf{Application Transaction:} test for successful application transaction between Student and Job Posting
        			\item \textbf{Successfully Create Classes:} test to successfully create Instructor, and Student.
        		\end{itemize}
        		
        	\end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        
        \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Persistence}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Reason to test:} This class is intrinsic to the job posting and application transaction. Without persistence capability the controllers have no data from which to derive the desired outcome
            \item \textbf{Test Cases:} 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item creation, modification and deletion of Course, Job, Application and Profile instances. 
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        
    \end{itemize}
    
    \subsection{Classes to Not Test}
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item \textbf{Application Manager}
    	\begin{itemize}
    		\item \textbf{Reason to not test:} This class acts as a container for Application and Job. It does not perform any action; hence, there are no actions for it to test.
    	\end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item \textbf{Profile Manager}
    	\begin{itemize}
    		\item \textbf{Reason to not test:} This class acts as a container for Student, Instructor, and Admin. It does not perform any action; hence, there are no actions for it to test.
    	\end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item \textbf{Course Manager}
    	\begin{itemize}
    		\item \textbf{Reason to not test:} This class acts as a container for Course. It does not perform any action; hence, there are no actions for it to test.
    	\end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    
    \section{Techniques and Tools}
    
    The system is to be designed in a complete Test-Driven Development paradigm. Hence all test cases will be written before the actual controllers are implemented. Furthermore, the order in which the tests will be passed follows the same order as the requirements derived in the Requirements document of deliverable \#1. This will aid the classification and prioritization of each bi-weekly runs' objectives. In parallel to this method, the team will rely heavily on code revisions by the senior members of the team to ensure the code written is up to visual, performance and logical standards. In terms of frequency, individual nightly tests will be ran on all platforms of the system and bi-weekly builds and test will be done every Saturday to ensure the deliverable validates and verifies the given requirements. To facilitate the testing process, the team will use the following tools:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Unit Test Framework:} Automated, well documented and supported system to allow a standardized set of tests to be done regardless of the platform. JUnit and PHPUnit will be used.
        \item \textbf{Test Coverage Tool:} Ensure that the measure to which the tests and actions cover the source code is optimal by function, statement, branch and condition standards. Its outputs will be used during the code revision sessions. EclEmma and PHPUnit will be used for this purposes.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \section{Coverage Statistics}
    
    \textbf{TODOOOOOOO}
    To the extent possible, include a quantification of your testing goal (e.g., N\% statement coverage or M\% branch coverage). 
    
    Furthermore, discuss how often your tests are executed, i.e., what triggers your tests to be run? Finally, describe any differences between your desktop/laptop app, mobile app, and web app when it comes to unit testing.

\part{Integration Test Plan}
%%%%%%%%%%%% ADD INTEGRATION TEST PLAN HERE%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Integration Strategy}
The strategy of integration will follow a bottom-up approach. The system will first have all the unit tests done for each class. Then the manager classes will integrate the units together into discrete subsystems. Since course manager is going to be used on all platforms, it was decided to test this subsystem first. Using EclEmma, we aspire to have near 100\% code coverage. This would imply that there should be near 100\% statement and branch coverage. Since our mobile app is only for students, there is no need to test the course manager on the mobile application. Likewise, the web app will not need to test the application manager since the web app is just for teachers. All the tests that follow are done programmatically rather than through a user interface. For example, Applying for a job will involve just creating an instance of an application and attributing it a profile, a job, etc. The system test will test whether the user can create a form and apply through the mobile application, for example.

\part{System Test Plan}
\section{Description}
The purpose of system testing is to validate the functionality of the system as a whole. System
tests are black-box tests, meaning they are done without any concern regarding the code - that is to
say, only the inputs and outputs are examined.\\\\
So as to examine the functionality of the system in an organized and systematic fashion, system
tests will be designed according to the various \textit{use cases} of the system. The use cases
provide concrete details concerning how each functionality of the system should behave, and in
particular how each functionality of the system should react to unexpected or faulty input.\\\\
The proposed system tests will be discussed below.
\subsection{Administrator-Specific Actions}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Sending Student Enrollment Data and Course List}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Valid data entered
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Enter appropriate data for student enrollment, as well as the course list, in the
					desktop application. Ensure that the proper XML files are generated.
			\end{itemize}
			\item Invalid student enrollment data entered
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Enter faulty student enrollment data (by omitting names, for example) and
					enter correct course list data in the desktop application. Ensure that an error
					message about invalid student data is made present. Moreover, assert that the
					corresponding student enrollment XML has not been generated at all, and that the
					course list XML file has been generated appropriately.
			\end{itemize}
			\item Invalid course list data entered
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Enter faulty course list data (by omitting required names, or by including
					non-integral course codes, for example) and enter correct student data in the
					desktop application. Ensure that an error message about invalid course list data
					is made present. Moreover, assert that the corresponding course list XML file
					has not been generated at all, and that the student enrollment XML file has been
					generated appropriately.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Generating Initial Student Job Placements}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Valid XML Application file is present
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Ensure that the appropriate XML file containing data about student
						applications is present. Use desktop application to generate default TA
						placement.
						\begin{enumerate}
							\item Verify that an appropriate XML file containing data about the job
								offerings was generated.
							\item Verify that initial placement confines to the budget for each
								department.
							\item Verify that graduate students were selected with higher priority
								than undergraduate students.
							\item Verify that the same student was selected for as many jobs as
								possible for the same course.
						\end{enumerate}
				\end{itemize}
			\item XML Application file not found or is corrupted
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Place invalid XML file (containing syntax errors or type mismatches, for
						example) in the appropriate location, and attempt to generate default TA
						placement with the desktop application. Ensure that an error message about
						the invalidity of the XML file is output, and that no XML file about job
						offerings has been created.
				\end{itemize}
		\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Accepting or Rejecting Instructor TA Modifications}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Accepting a modification
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Ensure that a list of all instructor modifications is present in the
						\textit{view proposed modifications} page. Select a modification for
						viewing, and select to accept the modification.
						\begin{enumerate}
							\item Ensure that the original allocations XML file has been overwritten
								using the data from the modification XML file that is currently
								active.
						\end{enumerate}
				\end{itemize}
			\item Rejecting a modification
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Ensure that a list of all instructor modifications is present in the
						\textit{view proposed modifications} page. Select a modification for
						viewing, and choose to reject the modification.
						\begin{enumerate}
							\item Ensure that the original allocations XML file has not been
								modified.
							\item Ensure that the modifications XML file has been deleted.
						\end{enumerate}
				\end{itemize}
		\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Send Job Offers}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Modification XML files present
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Ensure that a TA placement modification XML file is present. Attempt
						sending job offers in the \textit{view allocation} page.
						\begin{enumerate}
							\item Ensure that no \texttt{offers.xml} file is generated.
							\item Ensure that an error message informing the user that there are
								still outstanding modifications is output.
						\end{enumerate}
				\end{itemize}
			\item No modification XML files are present
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Remove all modification XML files, and ensure that initial allocation XML
						file is present. Attempt sending job offers in the \textit{view allocation}
						page.
						\begin{enumerate}
							\item Ensure that the \texttt{offers.xml} file has been generated with
								appropriate job offer data corresponding to the TA allocation.
						\end{enumerate}
				\end{itemize}
		\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Instructor Use-Cases}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Publish Job Posting}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item No course data found
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Remove all course data, or delete the \texttt{courses.xml} file. Attempt
						to open the page containing the \textit{publish job posting} form. Ensure
						that the page does not open, and an error message informing the user that no
						courses are available is output.
				\end{itemize}
			\item Course and Instructor data present
				\begin{itemize}

\section{Rationale}
The system tests that were designed, and their classifications by main actors, were done to provide
an organized scheme to verify that all functionalities of the system are covered by the system
tests. Given the fact that system tests should be black-box, it only remains to determine if the
desired use cases of the system are functioning according to the client's requirements.\\\\
To ensure that all requirements are met, the system tests were divided into categories specified by
the actor that would use those functionalities. Section \textbf{7.1} shows system tests associated
with the functionalities that only an Administrator would be responsible for. Then, section 
\textbf{7.2} shows system tests associated with the Instructor's actions. Finally, section
\textbf{7.3} shows system tests associated with the Student's actions. This categorization made it
much simpler to verify that all functionalities were tested, because it allowed functionalities to
be listed off as the Use Cases defined in the first Deliverable.\\\\
It is important to note that all logic-related bugs concerning the fine details of the calculations
carried out by the system should be already covered by the Unit Tests and Integration tests above.
Hence, the goal of the System Test plan is to design a routine that tests the communications and
interactions between subsystems that were tested in the Integration Tests. Such communications
involve mainly the flow of information from the View classes all the way down to the Controller
classes that store information about the domain entities in the persistence. All tests described in
section \textbf{7} verify the proper functioning of the input parsing from the Views, and the output
results of the persistence. Once again, everything that happens between the input and the output is
in a \textit{black-box}, and it is assumed to have been tested in the previous testing schemes.\\\\
Another important thing to consider when designing these System Tests is that the users will not
always enter valid inputs, and illegal actions may be attempted. Therefore, testing the ideal inputs
only is not a good idea, because it is equally important that the system handles erroneous or
invalid input properly as well. To take this into account, each System Test Case was examined, and
possible areas of invalid input were found. Each of those invalid input scenarios is accounted for
in the System Test plan. Most importantly, it is imperative that submitting erroneous input does not
affect the current persistence. Although each test case may experience significantly different
errors, if the persistence is not modified under these conditions, the errors will not affect the
\textit{bigger picture} of the whole system. Therefore, to complete each test case, any possible
invalid inputs are isolated, and it is verified that the persistence is not affected by them.\\\\
By carrying out the tests described in section \textbf{5}, it is ensured that all Use Cases have
been verified, and all bad behavior on the user's end can be handled reliably. Therefore, assuming
all tests succeed, it can be confided that all user requirements
are functioning properly. As the project continues, new System Tests may be implemented to reflect
changes in the user requirements.
\section{Test Coverage}
The goal of the System Test Plan described in sectio \textbf{7} is to achieve approximately 100\%
branch coverage. Statement coverage is likely to be very high with the compendium of the Integration
and Unit tests. Given the black-box nature of system testing, the focus should be more on the fact
that all branches of logic are tested rather than all statements individually.\\\\
Such test coverage statistics will be achieved by designing a state diagram of the system, and
ensuring that each state, as well as each state transition, is covered by the tests in section
\textbf{5}.
\section{Detailed Descriptions of Two Test Cases}
The following section will outline two system test cases in such great detail that they could be
implemented without the authors' assistance. Due to the omnicapable power of the desktop
application, the following two test cases will be described for testing on the desktop.
\subsection{The Publish Job Posting Test Case}
\subsubsection{Setting Up}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Remove prior XML files. If the system is being run from Eclipse, remove all files in the
		\texttt{output/} directory.
	\item Open the main menu
	\item Select ``Publish Job Posting''
	\item \textbf{Verify that the Publish Job Posting Window does not appear, but rather an error
		message saying that no instructors or courses are available is displayed.}
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Creating Instructor Profiles}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Open the main menu
	\item Select ``Register Profile''
	\item Select the Instructor radio button
	\item In the First Name field, type ``Jim''
	\item In the Last Name field, type ``Lahey''
	\item In the Username field, type ``hwn1977''
	\item In the Password field, type ``pswd''
	\item Click ``Submit''. A confirmation message saying ``Instructor hwn1977 was created'' should
		appear, and all fields are reset to blank.
	\item Now, for First Name, Last Name, Username, and Password, enter ``Randy'', ``Bobandy'',
		``cheeseburger'',``pswd2'' respectively. Finally, press submit and close the Register
		Profile window.
	\item From the main menu, select ``Publish Job Posting''.
	\item \textbf{Verify that the Publish Job Posting Window does not appear, but rather an error
		message saying that no courses are available is displayed.}
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Creating the Courses}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Open the main menu
	\item Select ``Create Course''
	\item The names ``Jim Lahey'' and ``Randy Bobandy'' should now be seen in the list view at the
		top. Select Jim Lahey.
	\item In the Course Name field, type ``FACC100 - Trailer Park Supervision''
	\item In the CDN field, type ``1''
	\item In the Grader Time Budget field, enter ``19000.0''
	\item In the TA Time budget field, enter ``14000.0''
	\item Click ``Create Course''. All data in the fields will be cleared.
	\item With Jim Lahey still selected, enter the values ``ECSE322 - Fixing Lawnmowers'', ``2'',
		``20000.0,'', ``15000.0'' into the course name, CDN, grader budget, and TA budget fields,
		respectively. Click submit.
	\item Next, select Randy Bobandy from the list at the top of the page.
	\item Enter the values ``ECSE211 - Dealing with Abuse From an Old Drunk Man'', ``3'',
		``13'',``8.75'' into the Course Name, CDN, grader budget, and TA budget fields,
		respectively.
	\item Click submit and close the Create Course menu.
\end{enumerate}
At this stage, enough data has been created to test the Publish Job Posting Use Case. The XML files
for profiles and courses should already be in the appropriate location.
\subsubsection{Publishing a Job Posting}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Open the main menu, and select ``Publish Job Posting''
	\item The names Jim Lahey and Randy Bobandy should be in the top-most list view. Select Jim
		Lahey.
	\item \textbf{Verify that ``FACC100 - Trailer Park Supervision'' and ``ECSE322 - Fixing
			Lawnmowers'' (and no other courses) appear in the list beneath the instructor names.}
	\item Select FACC100 - Trailer Park Supervision. Click ``Publish Job''.
	\item \textbf{Verify that an appropriate error message is displayed.}
	\item \textbf{Verify that, if there is already a \texttt{applications.xml} file, there is no
	mention of an application for Job with the current course name.}
	\item Enter ``10.5'' in the salary field, and ``Associate Trailer Park Supervision Experience''
		in the requirements field. Then, set the end time back by two hours so it is before the
		start time. Click ``Publish Job''.
	\item \textbf{Verify that an appropriate error message is displayed.}
	\item \textbf{Verify that, if there is already a \texttt{applications.xml} file, there is no
	mention of an Job for the course chosen.}
	\item Adjust the end time to be after the start time. Press ``Publish Job''.
	\item \textbf{Verify that the \texttt{applications.xml} file contains the data for a Job for
		this chosen course. If other Jobs were posted prior to this one, verify that their
	corresponding data remains in the XML file.}
	\item Chose Randy Bobandy from the top-most list. \textbf{Verify that ECSE211 - Dealing with
		Abuse From an Old Drunk Man is the only option in the list below.} 
	\item Select the ECSE211 option. Click ``Publish Job''.
	\item Repeat steps 6-11.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Applying for a Job}
\subsubsection{Setting up}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Remove prior XML files. If the system is being run from Eclipse, remove all files in the
		\texttt{output/} directory.
	\item Open the main menu
	\item Select ``Create Job Application''
	\item \textbf{Verify that the Job Application window does not appear, but rather an error
		message saying that no jobs or students are available is displayed.}
	\item Repeat the \textit{Creating Instructor Profiles} and \textit{Creating Courses} steps from
		section \textbf{8.1}.
	\item Repeat steps 2-3.
	\item Repeat the \textit{Publishing a Job Posting} steps from section \textbf{8.1}, and repeat
		steps 2-3.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Creating Students}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Open the main menu. Select ``Register Profile''
	\item Select the Student radio button.
	\item Enter the values ``Cosmo'', ``Kramer'', ``kman'', ``pennypacker'' into the First Name,
		Last Name, Username, and Password fields, respectively.
	\item Enter ``Golfing'' in the Skills textbox.
	\item Click ``Submit''. A message saying ``Student kman created'' should be seen at the top of
		the window, and all fields should be reset.
	\item Enter ``George'', ``Costanza'', ``vandelay'',``bosco'' into the First Name, Last Name,
		Username, and Password fields, respectively.
	\item Enter ``Baseball'' in the Skills textbox.
	\item Click ``Submit''. A message saying ``Student vandelay created'' should be seen at the top
		of the window. Close the window.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Creating A Job Application}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item From the main menu, select ``Create a Job Application''. The Job Application window should
		finally instantiate.
	\item Two lists should be present, one containing the student names, and the other containing
		the job names. In future versions of the system, students will log in and will not need to
		select their name from a list. For this version, select any student from the list.
	\item Without selecting a Job from the list, click ``Apply''.
	\item \textbf{Verify that an error message saying that no Job was selected is present, and
			ensure that the \texttt{applications.xml} file has not been modified.}
	\item Select a Job from the list. Click ``Apply''. A friendly message wishing the given student
		luck for his application to the selected Job will appear.
	\item \textbf{Verify that the \texttt{applications.xml} file has included the job application.}
	\item Repeat steps 5 and 6 with different combinations of students and Jobs.
	\item \textbf{Verify that no data is lost in the \texttt{applications.xml} file when multiple
		applications are created. That is to say, make sure the file has persisted all applications and
	all courses after multiple applications were submitted.}
\end{enumerate}
