\section{Description}
This phase will be be activated once the integrated code has tested and approved by the preceding phase. At this moment the code is ready to be released to the public, In the case of the Desktop application through a web market or physical mean,for the Mobile application through the Android marketplace or an APK sharing forum and for the web application through a a production server, such as a hosting web server to ensure its availability on the web. In this section we will go through the tools, design choices and specificities of each platform's deployment phase.

\section{Tools}
Within the paradigm of automatizing and avoiding manual repetitive tasks that is applied throughout the release pipeline, we look now at tools which can help with the process of deployment. These tools must be able to transfer the binaries, libraries and all other required file for the proper function of the product to each plataform in a seameless, errorless automated way. All while monitoring the process, gathering metrics which can help troubleshoot any errors or improve future deployments.

TODO ADD TOOLS FOR EACH PLATAFORM HERE WITH EXPLANATION

\section{Design}
The Deployment phase can be split into a set of well delimited activities which cover the entirety of the process. In this section we will describe them with relation to each available platform of the product.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Release}
    \item \textbf{Install/Activate}
    \item \textbf{Desactivate}
    \item \textbf{Uninstall}
    \item \textbf{Built-in Update}
    \item \textbf{Version Tracking}
    \item \textbf{Adapt}
\end{itemize}
\section{Rationale}

% Software training and support is important, as software is only effective if it is used correctly.[6] .[7]

% Maintaining and enhancing software to cope with newly discovered faults or requirements can take substantial time and effort, as missed requirements may force redesign of the software

% Software deployment is all of the activities that make a software system available for use.

% The general deployment process consists of several interrelated activities with possible transitions between them. These activities can occur at the producer side or at the consumer side or both. Because every software system is unique, the precise processes or procedures within each activity can hardly be defined. Therefore, "deployment" should be interpreted as a general process that has to be customized according to specific requirements or characteristics. A brief description of each activity will be presented later.
